1) Install Tools.  All of these can be found easily by Googling:

Install Python

Install Postgres

Install Node/npm

Install JDK 7

2) Navigate to workspace and clone the repo:

git clone https://username@bitbucket.org/svankina/senseus.git

3) install pip:
download get-pip.py from the website and run: python get-pip.py

4) pip install -r pip-requirements.txt

5) psql -U postgres
create user senseus with password 'senseus';
ALTER ROLE senseus SUPERUSER;

6) psql -U postgres -f database/create_db.sql
#Locales on Linux and Windows are different, you need to replace 'en_US.UTF-8' with 'american_usa' in the create_db.sql file

7) sudo npm install -g ionic cordova bower gulp

8) From here you can simply run the app by doing:

#cd senseus/ionic/senesus
#ionic serve
#This will launch the app in your default browser with live reloads.
#Windows handles the "static" file text ../../../static/ improperly--workaround is to just copy static folder into www directory, couldn't find better solution

#Run the backend server as usual: (Is this even necessary anymore?)
#cd senseus
#python server.py

--Now that the web app is working, these steps allow Android deployment --

9) Download and install VirtualBox

10) Download and install Android Studio

11) Install android 22 here by entering the following on CMD and checking correct packages
#android

12) Download and install Genymotion

#ionic platform add android
#ionic build

14) Open Genymotion, and add a new phone emulator (e.g. HTC One 4.4.4 API 19)

15) #ionic run android
#this will now run stuff on emulator or on device conected via usb.
